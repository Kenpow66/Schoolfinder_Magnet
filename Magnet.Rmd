## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r Magnet}
##Load tidyverse**

library(tidyverse)

##Load csv and create a dataframe and add leading zeros to campus number

Magnet <- read.csv('Magnet_R.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(campus_number= sprintf("%03d", campus_number))

Magnet <- na.omit(Magnet)


Magnet[, "magnet_boolean"] <- NA

names(Magnet)[1] <- "entity_id"
names(Magnet)[2] <- "magnet_status"

#Create structure to include all campuses regardless of programm offered
all_campuses <- Magnet %>% distinct(entity_id)

### change boolean to character


library(dplyr)

Magnet <- Magnet %>%
  mutate(
    magnet_boolean = ifelse(grepl("Magnet", magnet_status), "TRUE", "FALSE"))

  
Magnet_final <- Magnet %>%
  mutate(type = "magnet_boolean") %>%
  rename(value = "magnet_boolean") %>%
  select(entity_id, type, value) %>%
  arrange(entity_id)
  
Magnet_final[, "id"] <- ""

### save to csv file

write.csv(Magnet_final,"Magnet_final.csv", row.names = FALSE)


```
